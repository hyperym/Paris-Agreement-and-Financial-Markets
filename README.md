# Paris-Agreement-and-Financial-Markets
M2 small project in financial econometrics and dataviz.

This study examines whether the Paris Agreement (COP21, December 2015) generated
a differential stock market reaction between green energy companies and oil & gas com-
panies. Using a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) framework on daily stock returns of 36
companies across 9 countries over 2013–2018, we find a statistically significant negative
DiD coefficient (β3 = −0.120, p < 0.01). Contrary to expectations, green energy stocks
underperformed oil & gas stocks in the post-Paris period. This counter-intuitive result
may reflect the non-binding nature of the agreement, the oil price recovery in 2016–2017,
and the Trump administration’s withdrawal announcement. Fixed effects models and
country-level heterogeneity analysis confirm the robustness of our findings.
